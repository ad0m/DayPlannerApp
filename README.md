# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## My Rask

This task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.



## Info

You will be able to enter in your details for the day and click on the button on the right to save the info to local storage, if you refresh the page you will see the data remains static. If you do not click save and refresh the page, the data will be missing. 

## The colours indacate 

GREY - Time has passed 
RED - Current Hour 
GREEN - Future Events 

Essentialy letting you how your day is going and what is still to come and what time has now passed. 

---------------------------

My button on the right works, but is not displaying as I would like as not set up the button fully. However it functions correctly.
